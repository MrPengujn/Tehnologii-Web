          <h3>General info</h3>
          <p>
            Venus is the second planet from the Sun. It is named after the Roman
            goddess of love and beauty. As the brightest natural object in
            Earth's night sky after the Moon, Venus can cast shadows and can be
            visible to the naked eye in broad daylight. Venus's orbit is smaller
            than that of Earth, but its maximal elongation is 47°; thus, it can
            be seen not only near the Sun in the morning or evening, but also a
            couple of hours before or after sunrise or sunset, depending on the
            observer's latitude and on the positions of Venus and the Sun. Most
            of the time, it can be seen either in the morning or in the evening.
            At some times, it may even be seen a while in a completely dark sky.
            Venus orbits the Sun every 224.7 Earth days.[20] It has a synodic
            day length of 117 Earth days and a sidereal rotation period of 243
            Earth days. Consequently, it takes longer to rotate about its axis
            than any other planet in the Solar System, and does so in the
            opposite direction to all but Uranus. This means that the Sun rises
            from its western horizon and sets in its east. Venus does not have
            any moons, a distinction it shares only with Mercury among the
            planets in the Solar System.
          </p>
          <p>
            Venus is a terrestrial planet and is sometimes called Earth's
            "sister planet" because of their similar size, mass, proximity to
            the Sun, and bulk composition. It is radically different from Earth
            in other respects. It has the densest atmosphere of the four
            terrestrial planets, consisting of more than 96% carbon dioxide. The
            atmospheric pressure at the planet's surface is about 92 times the
            sea level pressure of Earth, or roughly the pressure at 900 m (3,000
            ft) underwater on Earth. Even though Mercury is closer to the Sun,
            Venus has the hottest surface of any planet in the Solar System,
            with a mean temperature of 737 K (464 °C; 867 °F). Venus is shrouded
            by an opaque layer of highly reflective clouds of sulfuric acid,
            preventing its surface from being seen from space in light. It may
            have had water oceans in the past, but these would have vaporized as
            the temperature rose under a runaway greenhouse effect. The water
            has probably photodissociated, and the free hydrogen has been swept
            into interplanetary space by the solar wind because of the lack of a
            planetary magnetic field.
          </p>
          <p>
            As one of the brightest objects in the sky, Venus has been a major
            fixture in human culture for as long as records have existed. It has
            been made sacred to gods of many cultures and has been a prime
            inspiration for writers and poets as the "morning star" and "evening
            star". Venus was the first planet to have its motions plotted across
            the sky, as early as the second millennium BC.
          </p>
          <p>
            Its proximity to Earth has made Venus a prime target for early
            interplanetary exploration. It was the first planet beyond Earth
            visited by a spacecraft (Venera 1 in 1961) and the first to be
            successfully landed on (by Venera 7 in 1970). The planet's thick
            clouds render observation of its surface impossible in the visible
            spectrum, and the first detailed maps did not emerge until the
            arrival of the Magellan orbiter in 1991. Plans have been proposed
            for rovers or more complex missions, but they are hindered by
            Venus's hostile surface conditions. The possibility of life on Venus
            has long been a topic of speculation; in recent years, the topic has
            received active research.
          </p>
          <br />
          <h3>Internal structure</h3>
          <p>
            Without seismic data or knowledge of its moment of inertia, little
            direct information is available about the internal structure and
            geochemistry of Venus. The similarity in size and density between
            Venus and Earth suggests they share a similar internal structure: a
            core, mantle, and crust. Like that of Earth, the Venusian core is
            most likely at least partially liquid because the two planets have
            been cooling at about the same rate, although a completely solid
            core cannot be ruled out. The slightly smaller size of Venus means
            pressures are 24% lower in its deep interior than Earth's.[109] The
            predicted values for the moment of inertia based on planetary models
            suggest a core radius of 2,900-3,450 km.[108] This is in line with
            the first observation-based estimate of 3,500 km.
          </p>
          <p>
            The principal difference between the two planets is the lack of
            evidence for plate tectonics on Venus, possibly because its crust is
            too strong to subduct without water to make it less viscous. This
            results in reduced heat loss from the planet, preventing it from
            cooling and providing a likely explanation for its lack of an
            internally generated magnetic field. Instead, Venus may lose its
            internal heat in periodic major resurfacing events.

          <h3>Orbit, rotation, and longitude</h3>
          <p>
            Venus orbits the Sun at an average distance of about 0.72 AU (108
            million km; 67 million mi), and completes an orbit every 224.7 days.
            Although all planetary orbits are elliptical, Venus's orbit is
            currently the closest to circular, with an eccentricity of less than
            0.01. Simulations of the early solar system orbital dynamics have
            shown that the eccentricity of the Venus orbit may have been
            substantially larger in the past, reaching values as high as 0.31
            and possibly impacting the early climate evolution. The current
            near-circular orbit of Venus means that when Venus lies between
            Earth and the Sun in inferior conjunction, it makes the closest
            approach to Earth of any planet at an average distance of 41 million
            km (25 million mi). The planet reaches inferior conjunction every
            584 days, on average. Because of the decreasing eccentricity of
            Earth's orbit, the minimum distances will become greater over tens
            of thousands of years. From the year 1 to 5383, there are 526
            approaches less than 40 million km (25 million mi); then, there are
            none for about 60,158 years.
          </p>
          <p>
            All the planets in the Solar System orbit the Sun in an
            anticlockwise direction as viewed from above Earth's north pole.
            Most planets also rotate on their axes in an anti-clockwise
            direction, but Venus rotates clockwise in retrograde rotation once
            every 243 Earth days—the slowest rotation of any planet. Because its
            rotation is so slow, Venus is very close to spherical. A Venusian
            sidereal day thus lasts longer than a Venusian year (243 versus
            224.7 Earth days). Venus's equator rotates at 6.52 km/h (4.05 mph),
            whereas Earth's rotates at 1,674.4 km/h (1,040.4 mph). Venus's
            rotation period measured with Magellan spacecraft data over a
            500-day period is smaller than the rotation period measured during
            the 16-year period between the Magellan spacecraft and Venus Express
            visits, with a difference of about 6.5 minutes. Because of the
            retrograde rotation, the length of a solar day on Venus is
            significantly shorter than the sidereal day, at 116.75 Earth days
            (making the Venusian solar day shorter than Mercury's 176 Earth days
            — the 116-day figure is extremely close to the average number of
            days it takes Mercury to slip underneath the Earth in its orbit).
            One Venusian year is about 1.92 Venusian solar days. To an observer
            on the surface of Venus, the Sun would rise in the west and set in
            the east, although Venus's opaque clouds prevent observing the Sun
            from the planet's surface.
          </p>
          <p>
            Venus may have formed from the solar nebula with a different
            rotation period and obliquity, reaching its current state because of
            chaotic spin changes caused by planetary perturbations and tidal
            effects on its dense atmosphere, a change that would have occurred
            over the course of billions of years. The rotation period of Venus
            may represent an equilibrium state between tidal locking to the
            Sun's gravitation, which tends to slow rotation, and an atmospheric
            tide created by solar heating of the thick Venusian atmosphere. The
            584-day average interval between successive close approaches to
            Earth is almost exactly equal to 5 Venusian solar days (5.001444 to
            be precise), but the hypothesis of a spin-orbit resonance with Earth
            has been discounted.
          </p>
          <p>
            Venus has no natural satellites. It has several trojan asteroids:
            the quasi-satellite 2002 VE68 and two other temporary trojans, 2001
            CK32 and 2012 XE133. In the 17th century, Giovanni Cassini reported
            a moon orbiting Venus, which was named Neith and numerous sightings
            were reported over the following 200 years, but most were determined
            to be stars in the vicinity. Alex Alemi's and David Stevenson's 2006
            study of models of the early Solar System at the California
            Institute of Technology shows Venus likely had at least one moon
            created by a huge impact event billions of years ago. About 10
            million years later, according to the study, another impact reversed
            the planet's spin direction and caused the Venusian moon gradually
            to spiral inward until it collided with Venus. If later impacts
            created moons, these were removed in the same way. An alternative
            explanation for the lack of satellites is the effect of strong solar
            tides, which can destabilize large satellites orbiting the inner
            terrestrial planets.
