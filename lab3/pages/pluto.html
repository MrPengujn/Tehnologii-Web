          <h3>General info</h3>
          <p>
            Pluto (minor-planet designation: 134340 Pluto) is a dwarf planet in
            the Kuiper belt, a ring of bodies beyond the orbit of Neptune. It
            was the first object discovered in the Kuiper belt and remains the
            largest known body in that area. After Pluto was discovered in 1930,
            it was declared the ninth planet from the Sun. However, beginning in
            the 1990s, its status as a planet was questioned following the
            discovery of several objects of similar size in the Kuiper belt and
            the scattered disc, including the dwarf planet Eris, leading the
            International Astronomical Union (IAU) in 2006 to define the term
            planet formally—excluding Pluto and reclassifying it as a dwarf
            planet.
          </p>
          <p>
            Pluto is the ninth-largest and tenth-most-massive known object
            directly orbiting the Sun. It is the largest known trans-Neptunian
            object by volume but is less massive than Eris. Like other Kuiper
            belt objects, Pluto is primarily made of ice and rock and is
            relatively small—one-sixth the mass of the Moon and one-third its
            volume. It has a moderately eccentric and inclined orbit, ranging
            from 30 to 49 astronomical units (4.5 to 7.3 billion kilometers; 2.8
            to 4.6 billion miles) from the Sun. Therefore, Pluto periodically
            comes closer to the Sun than Neptune. Still, a stable orbital
            resonance with Neptune prevents them from colliding. As a result,
            light from the Sun takes 5.5 hours to reach Pluto at its average
            distance (39.5 AU [5.91 billion km; 3.67 billion mi]).
          </p>
          <p>
            Pluto has five known moons: Charon (the largest, whose diameter is
            just over half that of Pluto), Styx, Nix, Kerberos, and Hydra. Pluto
            and Charon are sometimes considered a binary system because the
            barycenter of their orbits does not lie within either body.
          </p>
          <p>
            The New Horizons spacecraft performed a flyby of Pluto on July 14,
            2015, becoming the first and, to date, only spacecraft to do so.
            During its brief flyby, New Horizons made detailed measurements and
            observations of Pluto and its moons. In September 2016, astronomers
            announced that the reddish-brown cap of the north pole of Charon is
            composed of tholins, organic macromolecules that may be ingredients
            for the emergence of life, and produced from methane, nitrogen, and
            other gases released from the atmosphere of Pluto and transferred
            19,000 km (12,000 mi) to the orbiting moon.

          <h3>Discovery</h3>
          <p>
            In the 1840s, Urbain Le Verrier used Newtonian mechanics to predict
            the position of the then-undiscovered planet Neptune after analyzing
            perturbations in the orbit of Uranus. Subsequent observations of
            Neptune in the late 19th century led astronomers to speculate that
            Uranus's orbit was being disturbed by another planet besides
            Neptune.

            Percival's widow, Constance Lowell, entered into a ten-year legal
            battle with the Lowell Observatory over her husband's legacy, and
            the search for Planet X did not resume until 1929. Vesto Melvin
            Slipher, the observatory director, gave the job of locating Planet X
            to 23-year-old Clyde Tombaugh, who had just arrived at the
            observatory after Slipher had been impressed by a sample of his
            astronomical drawings.
          </p>
          <p>
            Tombaugh's task was to systematically image the night sky in pairs
            of photographs, then examine each pair and determine whether any
            objects had shifted position. Using a blink comparator, he rapidly
            shifted back and forth between views of each of the plates to create
            the illusion of movement of any objects that had changed position or
            appearance between photographs. On February 18, 1930, after nearly a
            year of searching, Tombaugh discovered a possible moving object on
            photographic plates taken on January 23 and 29. A lesser-quality
            photograph taken on January 21 helped confirm the movement. After
            the observatory obtained further confirmatory photographs, news of
            the discovery was telegraphed to the Harvard College Observatory on
            March 13, 1930.

          <h3>Orbit, rotation, and longitude</h3>
          <p>
            Pluto's orbital period is currently about 248 years. Its orbital
            characteristics are substantially different from those of the
            planets, which follow nearly circular orbits around the Sun close to
            a flat reference plane called the ecliptic. In contrast, Pluto's
            orbit is moderately inclined relative to the ecliptic (over 17°) and
            moderately eccentric (elliptical). This eccentricity means a small
            region of Pluto's orbit lies closer to the Sun than Neptune's. The
            Pluto-Charon barycenter came to perihelion on September 5, 1989, and
            was last closer to the Sun than Neptune between February 7, 1979,
            and February 11, 1999.
          </p>
          <p>
            Although the 3:2 resonance with Neptune (see below) is maintained,
            Pluto's inclination and eccentricity behave in a chaotic manner.
            Computer simulations can be used to predict its position for several
            million years (both forward and backward in time), but after
            intervals much longer than the Lyapunov time of 10-20 million years,
            calculations become unreliable: Pluto is sensitive to immeasurably
            small details of the Solar System, hard-to-predict factors that will
            gradually change Pluto's position in its orbit.
          </p>
          <p>
            The semi-major axis of Pluto's orbit varies between about 39.3 and
            39.6 au with a period of about 19,951 years, corresponding to an
            orbital period varying between 246 and 249 years. The semi-major
            axis and period are presently getting longer.
