          <h3>General info</h3>
          <p>
            Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only astronomical
            object known to harbor life. While large amounts of water can be
            found throughout the Solar System, only Earth sustains liquid
            surface water. About 71% of Earth's surface is made up of the ocean,
            dwarfing Earth's polar ice, lakes, and rivers. The remaining 29% of
            Earth's surface is land, consisting of continents and islands.
            Earth's surface layer is formed of several slowly moving tectonic
            plates, interacting to produce mountain ranges, volcanoes, and
            earthquakes. Earth's liquid outer core generates the magnetic field
            that shapes Earth's magnetosphere, deflecting destructive solar
            winds.
          </p>
          <p>
            Earth's atmosphere consists mostly of nitrogen and oxygen. More
            solar energy is received by tropical regions than polar regions and
            is redistributed by atmospheric and ocean circulation. Water vapor
            is widely present in the atmosphere and forms clouds that cover most
            of the planet. Greenhouse gases in the atmosphere like carbon
            dioxide (CO2) trap a part of the energy from the Sun close to the
            surface. A region's climate is governed by latitude, but also by
            elevation and proximity to moderating oceans. Severe weather, such
            as tropical cyclones, thunderstorms, and heatwaves, occurs in most
            areas and greatly impacts life.
          </p>
          <p>
            Earth is an ellipsoid with a circumference of about 40,000 km. It is
            the densest planet in the Solar System. Of the four rocky planets,
            it is the largest and most massive. Earth is about eight light
            minutes away from the Sun and orbits it, taking a year (about 365.25
            days) to complete one revolution. Earth rotates around its own axis
            in a day. Earth's axis of rotation is tilted with respect to its
            orbital plane with the Sun, producing seasons. Earth is orbited by
            one permanent natural satellite, the Moon, which orbits Earth at
            380,000 km (1.3 light seconds) and is roughly a quarter as wide as
            Earth. The Moon always faces the Earth with the same side through
            tidal locking and causes tides, stabilizes Earth's axis, and
            gradually slows its rotation.
          </p>
          <p>
            Earth formed over 4.5 billion years ago. During the first billion
            years of Earth's history, the ocean formed and then life developed
            within it. Life spread globally and began to affect Earth's
            atmosphere and surface, leading to Earth's Great Oxidation Event two
            billion years ago. Humans emerged 300,000 years ago, and have
            reached a population of almost 8 billion today. Humans depend on
            Earth's biosphere and natural resources for their survival, but have
            increasingly impacted Earth's environment. Today, humanity's impact
            on Earth's climate, soils, waters, and ecosystems is unsustainable,
            threatening people's lives and causing widespread extinction of
            other life.
          </p>
          <p>
            The modern English word Earth developed, via Middle English, from an
            Old English noun most often spelled eorðe. It has cognates in every
            Germanic language, and their ancestral root has been reconstructed
            as *erþō. In its earliest attestation, the word eorðe was already
            being used to translate the many senses of Latin terra and Greek γῆ
            gē: the ground, its soil, dry land, the human world, the surface of
            the world (including the sea), and the globe itself. As with Roman
            Terra/Tellūs and Greek Gaia, Earth may have been a personified
            goddess in Germanic paganism: late Norse mythology included Jörð
            ('Earth'), a giantess often given as the mother of Thor.
          </p>
          <p>
            Historically, earth has been written in lowercase. From early Middle
            English, its definite sense as "the globe" was expressed as the
            earth. By Early Modern English, many nouns were capitalized, and the
            earth was also written the Earth, particularly when referenced along
            with other heavenly bodies. More recently, the name is sometimes
            simply given as Earth, by analogy with the names of the other
            planets, though earth and forms with the remain common. House styles
            now vary: Oxford spelling recognizes the lowercase form as the most
            common, with the capitalized form an acceptable variant. Another
            convention capitalizes "Earth" when appearing as a name (for
            example, "Earth's atmosphere") but writes it in lowercase when
            preceded by the (for example, "the atmosphere of the earth"). It
            almost always appears in lowercase in colloquial expressions such as
            "what on earth are you doing?"
          </p>
          <p>
            Occasionally, the name Terra /'tɛrə/ is used in scientific writing
            and especially in science fiction to distinguish humanity's
            inhabited planet from others, while in poetry Tellus /'tɛləs/ has
            been used to denote personification of the Earth.[30] Terra is also
            the name of the planet in some Romance languages (languages that
            evolved from Latin) like Italian and Portuguese, while in other
            Romance languages the word gave rise to names with slightly altered
            spellings (like the Spanish Tierra and the French Terre). The
            Latinate form Gæa or Gaea (English: /'dʒi:ə/) of the Greek poetic
            name Gaia (Γαῖα; Ancient Greek: [gâi̯.a] or [gâj.ja]) is rare, though
            the alternative spelling Gaia has become common due to the Gaia
            hypothesis, in which case its pronunciation is /'gaiə/ rather than
            the more classical English /'geiə/.

          <h3>Orbit, rotation, and longitude</h3>
          <p>
            Earth's rotation period relative to the Sun—its mean solar day—is
            86,400 seconds of mean solar time (86,400.0025 SI seconds). Because
            Earth's solar day is now slightly longer than it was during the 19th
            century due to tidal deceleration, each day varies between 0 and 2
            ms longer than the mean solar day.
          </p>
          <p>
            Earth's rotation period relative to the fixed stars, called its
            stellar day by the International Earth Rotation and Reference
            Systems Service (IERS), is 86,164.0989 seconds of mean solar time
            (UT1), or 23h 56m 4.0989s. Earth's rotation period relative to the
            precessing or moving mean March equinox (when the Sun is at 90° on
            the equator), is 86,164.0905 seconds of mean solar time (UT1) (23h
            56m 4.0905s). Thus the sidereal day is shorter than the stellar day
            by about 8.4 ms.
          </p>
          <p>
            Apart from meteors within the atmosphere and low-orbiting
            satellites, the main apparent motion of celestial bodies in Earth's
            sky is to the west at a rate of 15°/h = 15'/min. For bodies near the
            celestial equator, this is equivalent to an apparent diameter of the
            Sun or the Moon every two minutes; from Earth's surface, the
            apparent sizes of the Sun and the Moon are approximately the same.
          </p>
          <p>
            Earth orbits the Sun at an average distance of about 150 million km
            (93 million mi) every 365.2564 mean solar days, or one sidereal
            year. This gives an apparent movement of the Sun eastward with
            respect to the stars at a rate of about 1°/day, which is one
            apparent Sun or Moon diameter every 12 hours. Due to this motion, on
            average it takes 24 hours—a solar day—for Earth to complete a full
            rotation about its axis so that the Sun returns to the meridian. The
            orbital speed of Earth averages about 29.78 km/s (107,200 km/h;
            66,600 mph), which is fast enough to travel a distance equal to
            Earth's diameter, about 12,742 km (7,918 mi), in seven minutes, and
            the distance to the Moon, 384,000 km (239,000 mi), in about 3.5
            hours.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Moon and Earth orbit a common barycenter every 27.32 days
            relative to the background stars. When combined with the Earth-Moon
            system's common orbit around the Sun, the period of the synodic
            month, from new moon to new moon, is 29.53 days. Viewed from the
            celestial north pole, the motion of Earth, the Moon, and their axial
            rotations are all counterclockwise. Viewed from a vantage point
            above the Sun and Earth's north poles, Earth orbits in a
            counterclockwise direction about the Sun. The orbital and axial
            planes are not precisely aligned: Earth's axis is tilted some 23.44
            degrees from the perpendicular to the Earth-Sun plane (the
            ecliptic), and the Earth-Moon plane is tilted up to ±5.1 degrees
            against the Earth-Sun plane. Without this tilt, there would be an
            eclipse every two weeks, alternating between lunar eclipses and
            solar eclipses.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Hill sphere, or the sphere of gravitational influence, of Earth
            is about 1.5 million km (930,000 mi) in radius.[148][n 9] This is
            the maximum distance at which Earth's gravitational influence is
            stronger than the more distant Sun and planets. Objects must orbit
            Earth within this radius, or they can become unbound by the
            gravitational perturbation of the Sun. Earth, along with the Solar
            System, is situated in the Milky Way and orbits about 28,000
            light-years from its center. It is about 20 light-years above the
            galactic plane in the Orion Arm.
